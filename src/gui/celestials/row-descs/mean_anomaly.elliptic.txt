The current mean anomaly (M) of the orbit.
The mean anomaly is the fraction of an elliptical orbit's period that has elapsed since the orbiting body passed periapsis.

    M = t × sqrt(μ / |a^3|) + M_0

...where:
t = the current time since epoch
μ = standard gravitational parameter of parent body
a = semi-major axis
M_0 = mean anomaly at epoch
(This equation is a generalization for all non-parabolic orbits)
