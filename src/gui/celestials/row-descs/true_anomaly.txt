The current true anomaly (ν) of the orbit.
The true anomaly of the orbit is defined as the angle measured at the parent body between the periapsis and the current position of this body.

  Elliptic case (e < 1):
    ν = 2 arctan((β sin E) / (1 - β cos E))
    β = e / (1 + √(1 - e^2))
  Hyperbolic case (e > 1):
    ν = 2 arctan(tanh(H / 2) ∙ √((e + 1) / (e - 1)))

...where:
E = current eccentric anomaly
H = current hyperbolic eccentric anomaly
e = eccentricity
