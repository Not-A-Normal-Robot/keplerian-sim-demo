The speed of the hyperbolic trajectory at its asymptote (v_∞).
As the time approaches infinity, the hyperbolic trajectory approaches a certain time but never quite reaches it.

    v_∞ = sqrt(μ × (e - 1) / r_p)

...where:
μ = standard gravitational parameter of parent body
e = eccentricity
r_p = periapsis
